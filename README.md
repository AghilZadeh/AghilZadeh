-👋 Hi, welcome to my GitHub. I'm Aghil Abed Zadeh, a physicist-turned-quantitative researcher working at the intersection of stochastic modeling, machine learning, and large-scale data systems. Here you'll find code from my research, personal projects, and the occasional thing built just for fun.
-👀 I have a Physics BSc and PhD from Duke, where I studied complexity and rare-event statistics in granular media. I then moved into computational neuroscience, building dynamical systems models of habit learning in the brain's striatal circuit. These days I work on macroeconomic and credit models in quantitative finance — but the thread connecting all of it is the same: extracting meaningful signals from noisy, complex systems.
-🌱 I'm broadly interested in scientific machine learning, stochastic modeling, and the overlap between physical intuition and modern ML — whether applied to financial systems, biological neural networks, or physics simulation.
