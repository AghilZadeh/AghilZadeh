- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to my github. Iâ€™m Aghil Abed Zadeh, a postdoc at Duke university department of neurobiology. Here you can find selected codes that I have developed during my research and some for fun.
- ðŸ‘€ I have a physics BSc and PhD. Currently, I conduct theoretical and computational research on biological neural networks, where we strive to understand habit learning in brain's striatal circuit. During my PhD, I studied complexity in natural phenomena by using experimental and computational study of granular media.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in studying neural dynamics and learning both in biological and artificial settings.  
- ðŸ“« You can learn more about me on my webpage at www.AghilZadeh.com
